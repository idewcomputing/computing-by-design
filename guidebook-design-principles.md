# Guidebook Design Principles

## Define a Clear Set of Phases

A project may require all four project phases or a subset, but the starting point for the project, subsequent phase deliverables, and final deliverable should be clear and consistent.

## Design for an Appropriate Level of Complexity and Knowledge

Each project should carefully consider the readiness of the target students and provide the needed scaffolding and technical support to be successful.

## Maximize Technology Accessibility

Specify the technological needs to match the expected accessibility of students. Recognize that the most successful entry level projects will limit the needs to an Internet-connected computer with a standard browser.

## Create Engaging Contexts and Goals

Create a project having a context and general goals that engage student interests while looking for any opportunity to inject social relevance into the project.

## Use State of the Art Techniques and Knowledge

Provide a project path that employs the current practices and technology applied in industry today or in the foreseeable future.

## Develop Templates and Code Libraries

Provide clear templates or examples for each deliverable and develop any code templates or libraries needed to make the technology accessible for the target students.

## Support Interdisciplinary Skills

Each project should provide a measure of breadth in the skills needed to complete each phase that reflect the interdisciplinary teams found in industry.
