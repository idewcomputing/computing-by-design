# Standard Project Outline

Each CxD project involves a sequence of three phases, each having its own driving question to help guide students towards solving the larger challenge. The the listed tasks can be applied generally across different problem domains or technologies, but the techniques and deliverables will be tailored for the particular problem, context, and technology. Each phase culminates in a presentation of each team's results for that phase.

### 1. DEFINE PROBLEM & PROPOSE SOLUTION

_Driving Question:  Which problem will you solve?_

Begin to frame the goals of your design by learning about your users and other stakeholders, the available technology, and the current practices to reach similar goals. Practice using the technology, in order to better understand its possibilities and constraints for design purposes. Consider various problems to solve. Evaluate and refine your ideas for a problem to solve through internal review and stakeholder feedback, in order to select a specific concept to target. Define the specific stakeholders, technology, and goals for a potential solution to your targeted problem.

* [ ] Analyze and Describe Problem Context 
* [ ] Analyze and Experiment with Technology 
* [ ] Generate Ideas and Evaluate Potential 
* [ ] Analyze Existing Solutions and Synthesize Ideas 
* [ ] Meet Stakeholders and Develop the Narrative 
* [ ] Define a Value Proposition and Map Features 
* [ ] **PRESENT PROPOSAL & COLLECT FEEDBACK**

### 2. DESIGN & BUILD SOLUTION 

_Driving Question:  How will you design and build your solution?_

Generate multiple prototypes for a solution. Evaluate and refine your prototypes through internal review and stakeholder feedback, in order to select a specific design to build. Define the specific features of the solution, in order to develop a pilot version based on the available time and resources. Build or code your solution in iterative stages.  Internally test your solution to verify its quality and identify any issues. Continually track your progress to finish on time.

* [ ] Generate Prototypes 
* [ ] Evaluate Prototypes 
* [ ] Map Technical System / Pseudocode 
* [ ] Plan Development & Testing Milestones 
* [ ] Develop Pilot Version & Test 
* [ ] Develop Plan for Launch & Promotion
* [ ] **DEMONSTRATE PILOT WITH PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL & COLLECT FEEDBACK**

### 3. EVALUATE & REFINE SOLUTION 

_Driving Question:  How effective is your solution?_

Evaluate the quality and value of your solution through stakeholder testing and feedback. Analyze the evaluation data to determine how well the solution met the design goals and to identify issues that may require further improvements. As time and resources allow, implement feasible improvements. __Demonstrate and present your project to a public audience to share the innovations and value provided by your solution to your targeted problem. Explain the process used to design, build, and evaluate your solution. Reflect on how the project experience impacted your personal development and your future educational and career interests.

* [ ] Evaluate Pilot Release
* [ ] Develop Final Release 
* [ ] Launch Final Release and Promote 
* [ ] Design Poster Summary 
* [ ] Compose Individual Reflections 
* [ ] Plan and Practice Presentation 
* [ ] **PRESENT FINAL RELEASE WITH POSTER & SHARE YOUR STORY**
