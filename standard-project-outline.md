# Standard Project Outline

Each CxD project involves a sequence of three phases, each having its own driving question to help guide students towards solving the larger challenge. The the listed tasks can be applied generally across different problem domains or technologies, but each will be tailored for the particular problem context. Each phase culminates in a presentation of a team's results for that phase.

### 1. DEFINE PROBLEM & VALUE PROPOSITION

_**Driving Question:**_  **Which problem will you solve and what improvement do you propose**_**?**_

* [ ] **Problem Definition & Importance** Analyze and describe the problem context and stakeholders.
* [ ] **Technology Experimentation & Summary** Understand the available resources and technology that may be part of your solution.
* [ ] **Initial Ideas & Evaluation** Consider a diverse set of solutions and evaluate each for potential.
* [ ] **Existing Solution Analysis** Analyze and evaluate existing solutions and borrow or synthesize ideas.
* [ ] **Stakeholder Profiles & Narratives** Meet stakeholders and co-develop an accurate narrative about the problem and proposed solution.
* [ ] **Value Proposition & Potential Features Map** Define a compelling value proposition and the intended features of the solution.
* [ ] **PROPOSAL PRESENTATION** Present a succinct proposal and collect further feedback to inform the details of your design.

### 2. DESIGN & BUILD SOLUTION 

_**Driving Question:**_  **What specific solution will you provide and how will you design and build it**_**?**_

* [ ] **Prototypes** Generate several distinct prototypes that represent creative perspectives on the solution details.
* [ ] **Prototype Evaluations** Evaluate the prototypes internally with the team and with stakeholders to verify the results.
* [ ] **Features Map & System Logic** Determine the solution specifications, logic, and interactions.
* [ ] **Development Plan & Testing Milestones** Prioritize development tasks and determine a plan to incrementally test the solution.
* [ ] **Pilot Development & Testing** Execute the plan methodically with frequent team check-ins.
* [ ] **Plan for Launch & Promotion** Determine the key actions to launch your solution with high impact.
* [ ] **PILOT DEMONSTRATION** Demonstrate the pilot development with promotional plan and collect feedback from peers.

### 3. EVALUATE & REFINE SOLUTION 

_**Driving Question:**_  **How effective is your solution and how will you improve it**_**?**_

* [ ] **Pilot Evaluation** Further evaluate the pilot release with stakeholders.
* [ ] **Final Release Development** Review the evaluation results and prioritize the fixes and improvements.
* [ ] **Final Release Launch and Promotion** Launch the solution with a clear call to action through your promotion.
* [ ] **Poster Design** Present the best artifacts to share the development story.
* [ ] **Individual Reflections**  Reflect on the experience and the impact on your future.
* [ ] **Presentation Plan & Practice** Take the time to know your audience and delivery plan.
* [ ] **FINAL DEMONSTRATION & PRESENTATION** This is your time to show everybody what you have done and share your story.
