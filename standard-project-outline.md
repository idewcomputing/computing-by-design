# Standard Project Outline

Each CxD project challenge has a driving question focused on designing and building a technology solution to a problem within a particular context using an emerging technology.

Each project involves a sequence of four phases. Each phase has its own driving question to help guide students towards solving the larger challenge. The specific tasks, methods, and deliverables within each phase are tailored for the particular problem, context, and technology. Each phase culminates in a presentation of each team's results for that phase.

## 1. Discover and Define a Problem

_Driving Question:  Which problem will you solve?_

Begin to frame the goals of your design by learning about your users and other stakeholders, the available technology, and the current practices to reach similar goals. Practice using the technology, in order to better understand its possibilities and constraints for design purposes. Consider various problems to solve. Evaluate and refine your ideas for a problem to solve through internal review and stakeholder feedback, in order to select a specific concept to target. Define the specific stakeholders, technology, and goals for a potential solution to your targeted problem.

## 2. Design and Build a Solution

_Driving Question:  How will you design and build your solution?_

Generate multiple low-fidelity prototypes for a solution. Evaluate and refine your prototypes through internal review and stakeholder feedback, in order to select a specific design to build. Define the specific design components of the solution, in order to develop a functional version. Create a plan to develop a functional high-fidelity prototype of your solution, based on the available time and resources. Code your solution in iterative stages. Create any content, assets, or other components needed. Internally test your solution to verify its quality and identify any issues. Continually track your progress to finish on time.

## 3. Evaluate and Improve the Solution

_Driving Question:  How effective is your solution?_

Evaluate the quality and value of your solution through stakeholder testing and feedback. Analyze the evaluation data to determine how well the solution met the design goals and to identify issues that may require further improvements. As time and resources allow, implement feasible improvements.

## 4. Share Project with Public

_Driving Question:  Why does your work matter?_

Demonstrate and present your project to a public audience to share the innovations and value provided by your solution to your targeted problem. Explain the process used to design, build, and evaluate your solution. Reflect on how the project experience impacted your personal development and your future educational and career interests.
