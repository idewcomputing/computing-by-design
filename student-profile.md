# Student Profile

_Computing by Design_ projects for iDEW students are designed to build skills in programming, design, and data. Further, the projects provide a deep experience in the applications of technology for students to **build confidence, develop intuition, exert influence, and express a unique voice**. Below you will find an explanation for each of these attributes that encourage students to take ownership of their learning.

### **CONFIDENCE**

I am learning the art of trying things, critically looking at the result, and then improving them. I am confident in the face of not knowing something, even in failing, because I have experienced the process leading to results.

* Iterative research of problem domains, applicable technologies, and stakeholders using industry practices.
* Iterative coding and data collection methods in HTML/CSS/JS, Arduino, Spreadsheets, and SQL.
* Iterative design practices with sketching, digital mockups, physical prototypes, and evaluation.

### **INTUITION**

I am experiencing a growing number of contexts and tools to build solutions. I am seeing patterns emerge and building intuition based on my practice. My intuition enables me to adapt to many circumstances.

* Using common reference materials for code syntax and examples across HTML/CSS/JS, Arduino, and SQL.
* Linking general concepts of programming \(variables, loops, functions, etc.\) across different languages and frameworks.
* Engagement of various real-world problem contexts.
* Application of diverse technologies - Web app, IoT, Video Games, Robotics, Chatbot, Data Visualization.

### **INFLUENCE**

I know I belong in the tech community because I have successfully contributed. I am convinced that I can change the world through thoughtful collaboration and intentional work.

* Application of industry practices and speaking the language of industry practitioners.
* Presentation and demonstration of project work in public, online, and in class contexts.
* Collection of feedback on project work and synthesis of findings for improving the value of solutions.

### **VOICE**

I have experienced the diversity of thought and approaches to solving problems and have witnessed it by analyzing various real-world products. My unique voice brings value to the creative work being done to solve problems, and I see the value of team member contributions.

* Filling unique roles within project team.
* Demonstrating flexibility and novelty in my approach to deliverables.
* Contributing to the collective solution to a problem.
